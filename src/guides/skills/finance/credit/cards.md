### Credit Card Incentives

Almost all credit card have some sort of incentives, some offer cashback percentages on certain purchases (ex. 1.5% back on all purchases or 5% back on dining) or they will offer a reward like mileage once you spend a certain amount (ex. 50,000 miles once you spend $2,000). Looking for the best credit card rewards is like a game in itself, but major companies usually have rotating deals so don't worry too much if you miss out on one. 

*Note*   
Just know that if you have never opened a line of credit your score will be low, **and that is ok!** Everyone has to start at some point, but the earlier you begin the easier it is to set yourself up for success in the future. Before opening a credit card you need to be sure that you are financially responsible and ready to start managing your expenses.

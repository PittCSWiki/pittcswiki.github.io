# Credit Cards and Credit Scores

One of the first things to understand is why a Credit Score important to **you**? Your credit score is a way for financial institutions to assess your risk as a borrower, which means it stretches across a bunch of different areas. Your credit score affects the rate you get on loans, credit cards you can get, insurance premiums, some apartments, and even cell phone plans. 

Now that we have an understanding of how your Credit Score affects you, lets go into **WHAT** a credit score is. Credit Scores range from 300-850, the higher the rating the more appealing the borrower is to lenders.

Your Credit Score is comprised of a few componenets, each component holds a different weight in it's contribution towards your score but we will go over that below. Something to know is that there are multiple companies that report credit scores but they all are calculated around the same components. Sometimes you will see a few point differences depending on the reporting agency so don't be alarmed if one reported score is a few points different from another.

### Components of Credit Score
*The Percentages shown are based on the FICO reporting agency*

#### Payment History: 35%

This component essentially comes down to one thing ****DO NOT MISS YOUR PAYMENTS****  
As long as you stay on top of your payments you will be good, but as you can see Payment History makes up **35%** of your credit score so missing payments will definitely drop your score a decent bit. Whenever you miss a payment you start accruing interest, which leads to a vicious game of playing catch up. Many beginner credit cards have something close to a 26% APR so every time you miss a payment your going to have an **ADDITIONAL 26%** that you have to pay off, on top of what you already owed. You can see how this can become real bad real fast.

#### Amounts Owed: 30%

This component refers to something called *Revolving Utilization* also sometimes called *Credit Utilization*. Your credit utilization is calculated based on the total credit that you have available and the percentage of that credit amount that you are using. An example would be if you have a credit card with a $10,000 and you spend $5,000 that would make your credit utilization 50% which is *BAD*. You will see online that people recommend keeping your utilization ratio less than <30% but ideally you want to keep it below **<10%**. There are a few ways to keep your credit utilization low

1. Make multiple payments per month so your monthly utilization is 10% or less. An example of this would be if you have a credit limit of $5,000 and you generally use $1,500 a month on expenses. Close to the end of your billing cycle you can pay off the majority of your amount and leave something between ~$50-$100 which gives you a very good utilization ratio of ~1-2% on your credit card statement. Additional note: A utilization rate of 1% is better than a 0% utilization.
2. Another way to lower credit utilization is to get more credit. With a higher credit limit, you have more leeway with how much you can spend before you get to those unsavory credit utilization ratios. The only issue with this is that if you don't have a stable income or a good history it becomes hard to open up new lines of credit.

#### Length of Credit History: 15%

Length of Credit is the average length of your credit lines. Generally, 3+ years is considered good, below that will have a negative effect on your score.

#### Types of Credit: 10%

This one is pretty simple, it just takes into account the types of credit accounts that you have and how you have managed them (ex. credit cards, retail accounts, loans, etc). Note: This does not mean you have to have a bunch of different types of credit.

#### New Credit: 10%

New Credit is calculated based on how many new accounts you have. For this, you want to avoid opening new accounts too fast, especially if you don't have a long credit history. If you are just starting off then you will naturally apply for more cards but you want to make to space out your applications if possible.


### Credit Card Incentives

Almost all credit card have some sort of incentives, some offer cashback percentages on certain purchases (ex. 1.5% back on all purchases or 5% back on dining) or they will offer a reward like mileage once you spend a certain amount (ex. 50,000 miles once you spend $2,000). Looking for the best credit card rewards is like a game in itself, but major companies usually have rotating deals so don't worry too much if you miss out on one. 

*Note*   
Just know that if you have never opened a line of credit your score will be low, **and that is ok!** Everyone has to start at some point, but the earlier you begin the easier it is to set yourself up for success in the future. Before opening a credit card you need to be sure that you are financially responsible and ready to start managing your expenses.

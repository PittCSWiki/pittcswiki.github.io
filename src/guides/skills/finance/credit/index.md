# Credit Cards and Credit Scores

One of the first things to understand is why a Credit Score important to **you**? Your credit score is a way for financial institutions to assess your risk as a borrower, which means it stretches across a bunch of different areas. Your credit score affects the rate you get on loans, credit cards you can get, insurance premiums, some apartments, and even cell phone plans. 

Now that we have an understanding of how your Credit Score affects you, lets go into **WHAT** a credit score is. Credit Scores range from 300-850, the higher the rating the more appealing the borrower is to lenders.

Your Credit Score is comprised of a few componenets, each component holds a different weight in it's contribution towards your score but we will go over that below. Something to know is that there are multiple companies that report credit scores but they all are calculated around the same components. Sometimes you will see a few point differences depending on the reporting agency so don't be alarmed if one reported score is a few points different from another.

### Components of Credit Score
*The Percentages shown are based on the FICO reporting agency*

#### Payment History: 35%

This component essentially comes down to one thing ****DO NOT MISS YOUR PAYMENTS****  
As long as you stay ontop of your payments you will be good, but as you can see Payment History makes up **35%** of your credit score so missing payments will definitely drop your score a decent bit. Whenever you miss a payment you start accruing interest, which leads to a vicious game of playing catch up. 





Just know that if you have never opened a line of credit you score will be low, *and that is ok!* Everyone has to start at some point, but the earlier you begin the easier it is to set yourself up for success in the future. Before opening a credit card you need to be sure that you are financially responsible and ready to start managing your expenses.

## What is a Credit Card? Why should I get one?
A credit card is simply an account you use to borrow money from a bank to buy good and services. With a credit card comes a bunch of details such as the limit or how much money/credit the bank allows you to use up to, billing cycles, interest rates, incentives, protections, and much more!

But, why should you get one? Credit cards do create some confusion in your financials as you might be spending money that you potentially don't have at the moment.  Unlike a debit card that takes directly from your account and sets a hard limit to your spending. But credit cards do provide some better advantages that debit cards don't have.

For a fairly simple and easy point for why get a credit card, you're not spending your money (at least not initially). You are spending the banks money meaning for the majority of credit cards they have protections against unauthorized purchases. And, in most of theses cases you are not liable for the unauthorized purchase and the bank will go out of their way to get their money back. This is opposed to if an unauthorized transaction occurs on your debit card. While most banks will also correct issues with unauthorized transactions, you don't have guarantees is all cases like a credit card can provide. 

Besides that fundamental benefit, let's see a little more in depth the other features of credit cards.

### Credit Card Benefits

#### Credit History


#### Rewards


#### Flexibility


#### Credit Card Incentives

Almost all credit card have some sort of incentives, some offer cashback percentages on certain purchases (ex. 1.5% back on all purchases or 5% back on dining) or they will offer a reward like mileage once you spend a certain amount (ex. 50,000 miles once you spend $2,000). Looking for the best credit card rewards is like a game in itself, but major companies usually have rotating deals so don't worry too much if you miss out on one. 

*Note*   
Just know that if you have never opened a line of credit your score will be low, **and that is ok!** Everyone has to start at some point, but the earlier you begin the easier it is to set yourself up for success in the future. Before opening a credit card you need to be sure that you are financially responsible and ready to start managing your expenses.

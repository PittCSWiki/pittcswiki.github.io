Now that you are making crazy money from all the internships your getting you're going to need a place to keep it! One recommendation for everyone would be to look into opening a a high yield savings account. High yield savings accounts are where you can keep your savings/emergency funds for no risk while still getting relatively high-interest gains. The interest on these accounts is know as the Annual Percentage Yield or APY for short. You ideally want to get the highest APY that you can, since that directly correlates with higher returns.

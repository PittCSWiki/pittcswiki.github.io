Product Management as a career is difficult to define, and my personal opinions on the career I chose change every year I give the 'Intro to Product' talk. I'll capture my consistent beliefs here.

## The important basics

The term Product Management can be defined by the two words "what" and "why". Everything else in the career is to gain a clearer understanding of these two concepts.

To elaborate:
- What (exactly) are we doing?
- Why should we do this (and not something else)?

Product Management as a career is difficult to define, and my personal opinions on the career I chose change every year I give the 'Intro to Product' talk. I'll capture my consistent beliefs here.

## The Important Basics

Product Management looks different *everywhere*. Sticking to the fundamentals will take you very far in your PM career no matter what exactly Product looks like in your organization. 

The first thing to remember is that the term Product Management can be defined by the three words "who", "what", and "why". Everything else in the career is to gain a clearer understanding of these two concepts.

To elaborate:
- Who (exactly) are we building this for?
- What (exactly) are we doing?
- Why should we do this (and not something else)?

In the scope of an engineering team, the job of the Product Manager is to clarify the work to be done, and have a clear reason why.

The second fundamental is to understand what makes a product. This is something that *somehow*, people with Ivy League degrees, venture backing, MBAs, and more occasionally don't understand.

Simply put, a product is the fix to a problem that people will pay not to have. This means that if you haven't identified a problem to solve, you don't have a product. We see it all of the time - at the moment of writing this, the AI boom has led to a lot of attempted products with no real problem to solve.

You now understand that your job is to generate clarity on who you're building for, what you're going to build, and why. How do you even do this?

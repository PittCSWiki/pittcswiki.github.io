# Writing Tips for Guides

We consider a page that includes useful information to be a 'guide'. It can be short, like "How to become a TA", or it can be a series,
like "Zero to Offer".

All of the guides are written by students the intent to help out other Pitt CS students which means we aren't looking for writing similar to a formal thesis. Conveying information in a manner that feels somewhat personal while informative is the desired tone for most guides.

The guides are written in Markdown so there is no built in spellcheck, that means you should make sure to check for spelling/grammar mistakes. For a useful guide on writing Markdown, please reference this [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/ShubhamSKadam/Markdown-CheatSheet).

## Guiding Principles

(Pun Intended)

We keep these things in mind when writing guides:

- Brief
- Unbiased
- Quality

We aim for brevity.

We try our best to be unbiased and professional, and we add
disclaimers because at the end of the day we are just college students and do
not really know what we are talking about.

And, we try to maintain a high quality bar by having our content reviewed
by other members.
